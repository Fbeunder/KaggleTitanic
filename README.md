# Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains code and analysis for the Kaggle Titanic competition, a popular introduction to machine learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Training data with survival outcomes
- Test data for making predictions

Key features include:
- Passenger class
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket information
- Fare
- Cabin
- Port of embarkation

## Repository Structure

This repository will be organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/`: Source code for reusable functions
- `models/`: Saved model files
- `submissions/`: Prediction files for Kaggle submission

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running the project will be added as development progresses.
